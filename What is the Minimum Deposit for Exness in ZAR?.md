### Factors Affecting the Minimum Deposit in ZAR

Several factors influence the minimum deposit amount in ZAR for Exness:

1. **Exchange Rates**: Since Exness often lists minimum deposits in USD, the ZAR equivalent depends on the current USD/ZAR exchange rate, which fluctuates daily. Traders should check the exchange rate at the time of deposit to ensure they meet the requirement.

2. **Payment Method**: Exness supports various payment methods, including bank transfers, credit/debit cards, e-wallets (e.g., Skrill, Neteller), and local options like Capitec Pay and EFT. Some methods, such as bank transfers, may have higher minimum deposit thresholds (e.g., $10 or R185 ZAR), while others, like e-wallets, may allow lower amounts.

3. **Account Currency**: Choosing ZAR as the account base currency eliminates conversion fees, making deposits and withdrawals more cost-effective. If the account currency is USD, deposits in ZAR may incur conversion charges based on Exness‚Äôs exchange rates.

4. **Regional Regulations**: Exness adjusts its policies based on the trader‚Äôs country of residence. South African traders benefit from FSCA regulation, but regional requirements may slightly affect deposit thresholds.
