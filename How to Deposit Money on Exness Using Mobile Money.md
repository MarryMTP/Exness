Popular Mobile Money services, such as **MTN Mobile Money**, **Airtel Money**, **Vodacom M-Pesa**, and **Tigo Pesa**, are widely used in African countries. These platforms enable users to perform transactions directly from their mobile phones, including depositing funds into online trading accounts like Exness.
