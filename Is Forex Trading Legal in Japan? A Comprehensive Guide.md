## What is Forex Trading?

Forex trading, or foreign exchange trading, involves exchanging one currency for another to profit from changes in exchange rates. Currencies are traded in pairs, such as USD/JPY (US Dollar/Japanese Yen) or EUR/USD (Euro/US Dollar). The forex market operates 24 hours a day, five days a week, and is decentralized, meaning trades occur globally through electronic networks.

The forex market is driven by various factors, including:

- **Economic data**: Inflation rates, employment figures, and GDP growth influence currency values.
- **Central bank policies**: Interest rate decisions by institutions like the Bank of Japan (BOJ) or the Federal Reserve impact exchange rates.
- **Geopolitical events**: Political instability or trade agreements can cause currency fluctuations.

In Japan, forex trading is particularly appealing due to the Japanese Yen‚Äôs status as a major global currency and the country‚Äôs sophisticated financial ecosystem.

- Investigating fraudulent activities and imposing penalties.
- Educating investors about financial risks.

The FSA‚Äôs strict oversight has made Japan‚Äôs forex market one of the safest for retail traders.

### Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA)

The **Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA)**, enacted in 2006, is the cornerstone of Japan‚Äôs financial regulations. It governs all financial instruments, including forex trading, and includes:

## Key Regulations for Forex Traders in Japan

Retail forex traders in Japan must comply with regulations designed to promote responsible trading and minimize risks. Key regulations include:

### Leverage Limits

Japan has some of the strictest leverage limits globally to protect retail traders. As of 2025, the FSA caps leverage at:

- **25:1 for major currency pairs** (e.g., USD/JPY, EUR/USD).
- **20:1 for minor and exotic pairs**.

These limits reduce the potential for large losses but may constrain profit opportunities for experienced traders accustomed to higher leverage in other jurisdictions.

### Margin Requirements

Traders must maintain a minimum margin to cover open positions. The FSA enforces **margin close-out rules**, automatically closing positions if a trader‚Äôs margin level falls below 50%. This protects traders from negative balances but requires careful position sizing and risk management.

### Taxation on Forex Trading Profits

Forex trading profits in Japan are classified as **miscellaneous income** and are subject to **income tax**. Tax rates depend on total annual income:

- **Up to ¬•1.95 million**: 5%.
- **¬•1.95 million to ¬•40 million**: Progressive rates up to 45%.
- **Over ¬•40 million**: 45% + 10% surtax.

Traders must report profits annually and maintain detailed trading records. Losses can be carried forward for up to three years to offset future profits, reducing tax liability.

### Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance

Brokers must comply with **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** and **Know Your Customer (KYC)** regulations. Traders are required to provide:

- Proof of identity (e.g., passport or My Number card).
- Proof of address (e.g., utility bill).
- Information about the source of funds.

These measures prevent illicit activities and ensure a secure trading environment.
