## Overview of Exness Raw Spread vs Zero Account

Founded in 2008, Exness is renowned for its reliable trading platforms, competitive fees, and transparent trading conditions. Both the Raw Spread vs Zero Account fall under Exnessâ€™s professional account category, tailored for traders who employ high-frequency strategies such as **scalping** or **day trading**. While both accounts offer low spreads and fast execution, they differ in fee structures, trading conditions, and target audiences.

### Raw Spread Account

The Raw Spread Account is designed to provide ultra-low spreads, often starting from 0.0 pips, by connecting traders directly to the interbank market. Instead of relying on spread-based fees, Exness charges a **fixed commission** per lot traded. This account is ideal for traders seeking real market pricing and cost efficiency in volatile market conditions.

### Zero Account

The Zero Account, on the other hand, offers **zero spreads** on 30 major trading instruments for 95% of the trading day. Traders pay a **commission** based on trading volume instead of spreads. This account is perfect for those who prefer predictable trading costs, especially for short-term strategies.
