## What Is Unlimited Leverage?

Leverage in forex trading is like a loan from your broker, allowing you to control a larger position than your account balance permits. It‚Äôs expressed as a ratio, such as 1:100 or 1:2000, indicating how much your trading power is magnified. For example, with 1:100 leverage, a $100 deposit lets you control a $10,000 position.

Exness takes this concept further with **unlimited leverage**, which removes traditional caps (like 1:1000) and theoretically allows traders to control positions worth millions with just a few dollars. This feature is particularly appealing to experienced traders who want to maximize returns on small market movements. However, it‚Äôs a double-edged sword‚Äîwhile it can amplify profits, it also magnifies losses, making risk management critical.

Founded in 2008, Exness has earned a reputation as a trusted broker, regulated by top-tier authorities like the **Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)** in the UK and the **Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC)**. Here‚Äôs why Exness is a top choice for traders seeking unlimited leverage:

## Eligibility Criteria for Unlimited Leverage

Unlimited leverage on Exness isn‚Äôt available by default due to its high-risk nature. To qualify, traders must meet specific prerequisites designed to ensure only experienced traders use this feature. Here are the conditions:

1. **Account Equity Below $1,000**: The total equity across all real trading accounts in your Personal Area (PA) must be less than $1,000. This encourages traders to maintain smaller balances to access unlimited leverage.
2. **Minimum Trading History**: You must have closed at least **10 orders** (excluding pending orders) across all real accounts in your PA.
3. **Minimum Trading Volume**: The cumulative trading volume of closed orders must be at least **5 standard lots** (or 500 cent lots) across all real accounts.

For demo accounts, unlimited leverage is available if the equity is set below $1,000 (e.g., $999.99 or less). Once these criteria are met, the option to select unlimited leverage will appear in the leverage settings of your qualifying trading account.

## Assets Available for Unlimited Leverage

Exness allows unlimited leverage on a wide range of instruments, including:

- **Forex Pairs**: Over 100 currency pairs, such as EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and exotic pairs.
- **Metals**: Gold (XAU/USD) and silver (XAG/USD).
- **Cryptocurrencies**: Bitcoin (BTC/USD), Ethereum (ETH/USD), and others (with caution due to volatility).
- **Commodities and Indices**: Select commodities like oil and indices like the S&P 500.

However, unlimited leverage is **not available** for exotic currency pairs, certain cryptocurrencies, stocks, and indices, as these have fixed margin requirements.

## Risks of Unlimited Leverage

While unlimited leverage offers immense profit potential, it comes with significant risks:

- **Magnified Losses**: A small adverse price movement can wipe out your account, as losses are amplified.
- **Margin Calls and Liquidation**: Low margin requirements increase the risk of margin calls or automatic position closure if the market moves against you.
- **High Volatility**: Instruments like cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, making them risky with unlimited leverage.

To mitigate these risks, implement strict risk management strategies:

- **Use Stop-Loss Orders**: Automatically close positions at a predetermined loss level to limit damage.
- **Limit Position Sizes**: Avoid over-leveraging by trading smaller lot sizes.
- **Monitor Margin Levels**: Keep an eye on your account‚Äôs margin level to avoid liquidation.
- **Diversify Trades**: Spread risk across different asset classes instead of focusing on one trade.

## Tips for Using Unlimited Leverage Effectively

To maximize the benefits of unlimited leverage while minimizing risks, follow these best practices:

1. **Develop a Trading Plan**: Outline your entry and exit points, risk tolerance, and position sizing rules before trading.
2. **Start Small**: Test unlimited leverage on a demo account to understand its impact without risking real money.
3. **Stay Informed**: Monitor market news and volatility, as sudden price swings can be devastating with high leverage.
4. **Use Exness Tools**: Leverage Exness‚Äôs risk management tools, such as real-time analytics and margin calculators, to make informed decisions.
5. **Maintain Discipline**: Avoid emotional trading and stick to your strategy, even during market fluctuations.

## Is Unlimited Leverage Right for You?

Unlimited leverage is a powerful tool, but it‚Äôs not suitable for everyone. It‚Äôs best suited for **experienced traders** with a proven track record, strong risk management skills, and the ability to absorb potential losses. Beginners should start with lower leverage (e.g., 1:100 or 1:200) to build experience before attempting unlimited leverage.

If you‚Äôre new to forex trading, consider practicing on a demo account with unlimited leverage to simulate real-market conditions. This allows you to refine your strategy without financial risk.

## Conclusion

By meeting the eligibility criteria‚Äîequity below $1,000, 10 closed orders, and 5 standard lots‚Äîyou can unlock this feature and trade across various instruments like forex pairs, metals, and cryptocurrencies.
