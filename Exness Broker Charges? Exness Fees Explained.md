## Types of Exness Fees

Exness implements a transparent fee structure, primarily consisting of trading and non-trading fees. Below, we explore the main categories of charges you‚Äôll encounter when trading with Exness.

### 1. Spreads: The Core Trading Cost

The **spread** is the difference between the bid (buy) and ask (sell) prices of a financial instrument. It‚Äôs one of the primary ways brokers like Exness generate revenue. Exness offers both **fixed** and **variable spreads**, depending on the account type and market conditions.

- **Standard Accounts**: These accounts typically have wider spreads (starting from 0.3 pips) but are commission-free, making them ideal for beginners or low-frequency traders.
- **Pro Accounts**: Designed for experienced traders, Pro accounts offer tighter spreads (from 0.1 pips) with no commissions.
- **Raw Spread and Zero Accounts**: These accounts provide ultra-low spreads (from 0.0 pips) but charge a commission per trade.

For example, the EUR/USD pair on a Standard account might have an average spread of 0.9 pips, while a Raw Spread account could offer spreads as low as 0.1 pips with a commission of $3.50 per lot per side.

### 2. Commissions: Account-Specific Charges

Commissions are fees charged per trade and apply only to certain Exness account types, such as **Raw Spread** and **Zero accounts**. These accounts are tailored for high-frequency traders or scalpers who benefit from ultra-tight spreads.

- **Raw Spread Account**: Charges a fixed commission of $3.50 per lot per side (total $7 per round-trip trade).
- **Zero Account**: Offers zero spreads on select instruments but charges a variable commission, typically ranging from $0.05 to $3.50 per lot per side, depending on the asset.

Standard and Pro accounts are commission-free, making them cost-effective for traders who prioritize simplicity over ultra-low spreads.

### 3. Swap Fees: Overnight Position Costs

**Swap fees**, also known as overnight or financing fees, apply when you hold a position open past the market‚Äôs daily cutoff time (typically 5 p.m. EST). These fees are based on the interest rate differential between the two currencies in a forex pair or the financing cost for other assets.

- Exness offers **swap-free accounts** (Islamic accounts) for traders who cannot incur swap fees due to religious reasons. These accounts are also available for certain instruments like cryptocurrencies, majors, and gold.
- Swap rates can be positive or negative. For example, holding a long position on EUR/USD with a higher USD interest rate may result in a negative swap, deducted from your account. Conversely, a positive swap credits your account.

**Pro Tip**: To avoid swap fees, consider day trading or closing positions before the daily cutoff. You can check swap rates directly on the Exness trading platform (MT4/MT5) by right-clicking an instrument in the Market Watch window and selecting ‚ÄúSpecification.‚Äù

### 4. Non-Trading Fees: Deposits, Withdrawals, and Inactivity

Unlike many brokers, Exness stands out for its minimal **non-trading fees**, which include deposit, withdrawal, and inactivity charges.

- **Deposit Fees**: Exness does not charge fees for deposits, regardless of the payment method (bank transfers, credit/debit cards, e-wallets, or cryptocurrencies). However, third-party providers like banks or e-wallets may impose their own fees.
- **Withdrawal Fees**: Exness covers withdrawal fees for most methods, including bank transfers, cards, and e-wallets. Cryptocurrency withdrawals are typically instant and fee-free, though blockchain network fees may apply.
- **Inactivity Fees**: Exness does not charge inactivity fees, making it a great choice for casual traders who may take breaks from trading.
