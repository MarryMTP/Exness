### Step 5: Practice Trading Strategies

The demo account is an ideal environment for testing trading strategies. Here are three beginner-friendly strategies to try:

   - Focuses on short-term trades to capture small price movements.
   - Use 1-minute or 5-minute charts and trade high-liquidity pairs like EUR/USD.
   - Example: Enter a buy trade when the price crosses above a 20-period Moving Average and exit after a 5-pip gain.

2. **Day Trading**:
   - Involves opening and closing trades within a single day to avoid overnight risks.
   - Use 15-minute or 1-hour charts and combine indicators like RSI and Bollinger Bands.
   - Example: Buy when RSI shows oversold conditions and the price touches the lower Bollinger Band.

3. **Swing Trading**:
   - Holds trades for days or weeks to capture larger price trends.
   - Use 4-hour or daily charts and tools like Fibonacci retracement or trendlines.
   - Example: Enter a trade at a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level during an uptrend.

### Step 6: Analyze Your Performance

To get the most out of your demo account, regularly evaluate your trading performance:

   - Monitor metrics like **win rate**, **average profit/loss**, and **maximum drawdown**.
   - Use external tools like Myfxbook or a spreadsheet to log trades.

3. **Refine Your Approach**:
   - Adjust strategies based on your analysis. For example, if scalping results in losses, try day trading with stricter entry rules.
   - Experiment with different indicators, timeframes, and risk levels.

### Step 7: Prepare for Live Trading

Once you‚Äôre confident in your demo account performance, you can transition to a live account. Here‚Äôs how to make a smooth shift:

   - Open a **Standard Cent** or **Standard** account with a modest deposit to minimize risk.

3. **Implement Risk Management**:
   - Risk no more than 1-2% of your account balance per trade.
   - Always set **Stop Loss** and **Take Profit** to protect your capital.
