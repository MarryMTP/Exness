## Is Forex Trading Legal in Kenya?

**Yes, forex trading is legal in Kenya**, provided traders operate within the regulatory framework established by the government and financial authorities. Unlike some countries with strict restrictions on forex trading, Kenya has a relatively open approach, encouraging financial innovation while prioritizing consumer protection.

The **Capital Markets Authority (CMA)** is the primary regulatory body overseeing forex trading in Kenya. The CMA ensures that brokers and financial institutions comply with laws to protect traders from fraud and unethical practices.

### Key Points About Forex Trading Legality in Kenya:
1. **Regulated Brokers**: Forex trading is legal when conducted through brokers licensed by the CMA or reputable international regulators.
2. **No Ban on Retail Trading**: Individual traders can participate in forex trading without restrictions, unlike in some jurisdictions where retail forex is limited.
