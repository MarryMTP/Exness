## Why Choose an FSCA-Regulated Forex Broker?

The FSCA, formerly known as the Financial Services Board (FSB), is a Tier-1 regulator responsible for overseeing South Africa‚Äôs non-banking financial sector. Established in 1991 and rebranded in 2018, the FSCA enforces strict rules to protect traders, including:

- **Segregation of Client Funds**: Brokers must keep client funds separate from operational funds, ensuring safety in case of insolvency.
- **Regular Inspections**: FSCA conducts audits to ensure compliance with financial regulations.
- **Compensation Schemes**: Traders are protected with compensation orders in case of broker misconduct.
- **Transparency**: Brokers must disclose risks, fees, and trading conditions clearly.

Choosing an FSCA-regulated broker minimizes risks associated with unregulated platforms, such as fraud or fund mismanagement. With South Africa‚Äôs forex market projected to handle over $19.1 billion in daily trading volume, selecting a trusted broker is more critical than ever.
